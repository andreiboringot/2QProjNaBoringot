                <p id="important">Getting vaccinated doesn't 
                    automatically mean that you are safe from
                    the virus. When you catch the virus, the symptoms 
                    would be less contagious. Let us remember than even
                    we are vaccinated already, we must not forget to follow
                    the safety prtocols because there is still a chance for us 
                    to catch the virus.

                <p>With the help of the vaccine you are less likely to get infected,
                    but let us not ignore the fact that the vaccine doesn't have a 
                    hundred percent efficiency, so we must not forget to follow the 
                    minimum health and safety protocols.</p>

                <p>Studies have found that expectant mothers who receive the 
                    COVID-19 vaccine create antibodies to the virus and pass 
                    those to their unborn baby through the placenta.</p>

                <p>This means that if we catch the virus, its symptoms wouldn't be that bad.
                    We will most likely have a mild case of COVID-19.
